# Test Task
#### **Task:** Develop a SDK for accessing a weather API ( https://openweathermap.org/api )
#### **Objective:** The objective of this task is to develop a software development kit (SDK) that can be used by
other developers to easily access a weather API and retrieve weather data for a given location.
#### **Requirements:**
The SDK must be written in any programming language from a list: Java, C#, Python, Ruby.
Implementation in two languages will be a big advantage.
The SDK must be easy to use, with clear and concise documentation. Having the SDK loaded into the
package manager would be an advantage. Big advantage: having a script which can upload a new version
of SDK into the package manager.
The SDK must provide an interface for querying the weather API and returning the weather data in a
standard JSON format.
The SDK must include examples of how to use the SDK to retrieve weather data for a given location. Big
advantage: having a Readme.md file with samples of using (e.g.
https://github.com/Kameleoon/client-react )
The SDK must handle any errors that might occur when accessing the weather API, such as invalid API
key, network issues, and others.
The code must be well-documented and include appropriate error handling and input validation.
#### **Deliverables:**
The source code for the SDK in at least one programming language.
Documentation for the SDK, including installation and usage instructions.
Examples of how to use the SDK to retrieve weather data.
#### **Evaluation Criteria:**
The functionality of the SDK, including the ability to retrieve weather data for a given location.
The quality of the code, including readability, documentation, and error handling.
The ease of use of the SDK, including the installation process and the clarity of the documentation.
The reliability of the SDK, including the handling of errors and unexpected conditions.
#### Technical Documentation:
1. The SDK should accept API KEY for OpenWeatherAPI on initialization
2. The SDK should accept the name of the city and return information about the weather at the current
   moment. The SDK returns information about the first city which was found by searching for the city
   name.
3. The SDK should store weather information about the requested cities and if it is relevant, return the
   stored value (Weather is considered to be up to date if less than 10 minutes have passed)
4. In order to save memory, the SDK can store information for no more than 10 cities at a time.
5. The SDK should have two types of behavior: on-demand and polling mode. In on-demand mode the
   SDK updates the weather information only on customer requests. In polling mode SDK requests new
   weather information for all stored locations to have zero-latency response for customer requests.
   Mode of the SDK should be passed as parameter on initialization.
6. The SDKâ€™s methods should throw an exception with a description of the reason in case of failure.
7. Advantage: design the process of creating the SDK so that you can work with different keys, while
   creating two copies of an object with the same key is not possible. Also add a method to delete the
   object.
8. Big advantage: having unit tests for SDK methods (use mocks for network requests)
####   **Intended JSON structure in SDK API response:**
   {
   "weather": {
   "main": "Clouds",
   "description": "scattered clouds",
   },
   "temperature": {
   "temp": 269.6,
   "feels_like": 267.57,
   },
   "visibility": 10000,
   "wind": {
   "speed": 1.38,
   },
   "datetime": 1675744800,
   "sys": {
   "sunrise": 1675751262,
   "sunset": 1675787560
   },
   "timezone": 3600,
   "name": "Zocca",
   }
